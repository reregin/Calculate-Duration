# Calculate Duration

### About
This is the source code of Selection Construction assignment from a first semester course: Algorithms and Programming. We were given few cases to code and the one that I chose was **calculating duration between two specific times in HH:MM:SS format**. This code is written using C++.

### A little notes
The `.cpp` code can be seen inside the 'Durasi' folder.
